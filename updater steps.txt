1. Run the following cmd command: npm run tauri signer --generate -- -w <PATH>/<keyname>.key
- <PATH> can be any path you want on your system.
- Once it has completed, both the Private and Public key files will be inside the directory specified in <PATH>

*** MAKE SURE TO BACK UP YOUR PRIVATE KEY SOMEWHERE REALLY SAFE, AS YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO UPDATE YOUR EXE AGAIN IF YOU LOSE IT ***

2. Type "env" into the Start Menu, and open the "Edit the system environmental variables" option. Then click "Environmental variables..."

3. In both the "User" and "System" sections, click "New...", then add the following:
- Variable name: TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY
- Variable value: <Content of the generated "<your app name>.key" file>
- Variable name: TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD
- Variable value: The password you set to generate the keys in step 1.

*** RESTART YOUR PC TO ENABLE THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES ***

4. Add the following to "tauri.conf.json":

"updater": {
    "active": true,
    "endpoints": [ "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/main/<updater file>.json" ],
    "pubkey": "<Content of the generated "<your app name>.key.pub" file>"
}

*"endpoints" should be the URL of the file that you are using as your updater JSON file

5. Update the "package > version" field in "tauri.conf.json", and also update the "version" field in "package.json" to reflect the updated version.

6. Run: npm run tauri build
- Once built, the "src-tauri > target > release > bundle > <Bundle type>" folder should contain 3 files:
    - The built installer/EXE (<your app name>_<version>_<arch>.exe)
    - The update ZIP (<your app name>_<version>_<arch>.<filetype>.zip)
    - The update signature file (<your app name>_<version>_<arch>.<filetype>.zip.sig)

7. Upload the newest update ZIP to your repo root.

8. Update "<updater file>.json" with the following:
- The new "version" number
- The new "url", which should reflect the name of the update ZIP file (as the version string will have changed upon building) - e.g. "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jackson0ne/updatertest/main/updatertest_0.1.1_x64-setup.nsis.zip"
- The new update "signature" string (as the signature will have changed upon building)

{
  "version": "0.1.1",
  "notes": "New update pushed",
  "platforms": {
    "windows-x86_64": {
      "signature": "1234567890abcdefg...",
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/main/<your app name>_0.1.1_x64-setup.nsis.zip"
    }
  }
}
